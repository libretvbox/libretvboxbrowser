The LibreTVbox browser is the waterfox with the following changes:
- no url and taps bar
- always remember username and passwords without asking
- easy navigating of websites with the LibreTVbox remote
- clicking on back button on the remote often enough will exit browser
- always automatically on full screen mode
- needed components for watching DRM content preloaded
